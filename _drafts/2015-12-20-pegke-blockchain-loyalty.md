This portability extends beyond internal company economies, and creates the potential for employee incentive programs to bridge with, say, customer loyalty programs from third party companies. If customer loyalty programs began supporting cryptocurrency, then it could become a means of porting value between the programs.

## Why not GiftCards ?

The system has a lot of leakage, from stealing by employees, counterfeiting and skimming of numbers. According to the [National Retail Foundation](http://www.comm-works.com/limitless/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Loss-Prevention-Page.pdf), 78% of retailers have been the victim of gift card fraud. Usually, it’s not possible to tell a code has been compromised until the gift recipient tries to redeem it, and then it’s impossible to identify who the fraudster was.



Using the blockchain would represent an improvement in security over this system. A blockchain-powered process generates a new address for each transaction, even if the ultimate destination is the same. So, a consumer would receive a gift card into her wallet with one address and send that gift card back to the merchant’s wallet with another address.

## Why CryptoCoins

> Cash rewards are less productive than non-cash rewards. Blockchain would allow small businesses a “very cheap, very secure and very fast” solution.

Would companies running their own non-interchangeable points reward programs want to begin accepting cryptocurrency? Possibly not. After all, by controlling their own points in a closed system, they get to set the value of a room, or airline flight, for points holders. But if cryptocurrency makes enough inroads into the employee incentive space, and establishes a foothold in the customer loyalty world, they may not have a choice. Increased portability between other loyalty programs would eventually decrease the attraction of a closed loop system, forcing their hand.

Another advantage is the real-time aspect of Blockchain technology, which allows reward points to be instantly updated and available for use.
