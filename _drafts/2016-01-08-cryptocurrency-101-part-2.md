excerpt: Cryptocurrency 101 - Why use cryptocurrencies instead of cash.
---

This is probably the most common question asked.
First, we need to take a look at the evolution of trade:

* Initially, trade was done through a barter system. You have an asset I want, I have an asset you want, let’s trade. Here, a apple farmer can trade his apples to a sheep herder for wool.
* Here, we run into a problem. What if you don’t have something I want? Metals, particularly gold and silver, were often used as a mechanism for trade.
* With the rise of kingdoms and nations, many wanted to show their reign and would melt metals and recast them to showcase an emblem with their nation.
* Eventually, nations realized that metals weren’t efficient, and paper money was created.
* With the rise of the internet, we now have online banking, where currency is just digital figures.


This is a simple look, but it’s obvious that cryptocurrencies are the next evolution of trade.

> Like most features in evolution, the unregulated — capitalistic supply/demand — aspect is based off the Great Recession of 2007.
