## Is Ethereum better than Bitcoin? Why or why not?

Bitcoin is the original Blockchain entity. Ethereum exploits the full potential of the blockchain. It puts the blockchain to work for purposes beyond the bookkeeping of financial transactions.

Bitcoin is dedicated to moving and validating money. It also incorporates Smart Contracts which addresses the goals of Ethereum.

Ethereum is written in a [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) Language - Bitcoin was written in a stack based language that isn't Turing Complete. A Turing complete language means anything can be done with it given enough time and enough computing power.

This means that Ethereum has a broader base to build on and a broader market to enter - as it isn't locked to being a value transfer ledger - which is where the analogy of ethereum as a tcp/icp in comparison to bitcoin as your email comes in.

## Ethereum differs from Bitcoin in 7 main ways

 1. In Ethereum the block time is set to twelve seconds compared to Bitcoins 10 minutes. This allows for faster transaction times. Ethereum does this by using the Ghost protocol.
 2. Ethereum has a slightly different economic model than Bitcoin – Bitcoin block rewards halve every 4 years whilst Ethereum releases the same amount of Ether each year ad infinitum.
 3. Ethereum has a different method for costing transactions depending on their computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs. Bitcoin transactions compete equally with each other. This is called Gas in Ethereum and is limited per block whilst in Bitcoin it is limited by the block size.
 4. Ethereum has its own Turing complete internal code... a Turing complete code means that given enough computing power and enough time... anything can be calculated. With Bitcoin there is not this form of flexibility.
 5. Ethereum was crowd funded whilst Bitcoin was released and early miners own most of the coins that will ever be mined. With Ethereum 50% of the coins will be owned by miners in year five.
 6. Ethereum discourages centralised pool mining through its Ghost protocol rewarding stale blocks. There is no advantage to being in a pool in terms of block propagation.
 7. Ethereum uses a memory hard hashing algorithm called Ethash that mitigates against the use of ASICS, and encourages decentralised mining by individuals using their GPU’s.
