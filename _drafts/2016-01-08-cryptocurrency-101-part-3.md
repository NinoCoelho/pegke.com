## So what is the blockchain?
A blockchain is a magic computer that anyone can upload programs to and leave the programs to self-execute, where the current and all previous states of every program are always publicly visible, and which carries a very strong cryptoeconomically secured guarantee that programs running on the chain will continue to execute in exactly the way that the blockchain protocol specifies.

The blockchain itself is a relatively immature technology, but one with a huge amount of potential.

## Beyond the blockchain
Ethereum aims to unlock the potential of blockchains outside of the currency-on-blockchain concept. Whilst Bitcoin uses a shared ledger, Ethereum is a shared computer based on its cryptocurrency “Ether”. Ethereum adds additional capabilities such as adding Turing complete scripting languages, components can communicate with each yet are prevented from running in infinite loops by forcing them to consuming Ether. Infinitely running applications would therefore be expensive, and successful applications require large amounts of Ether to run.

When we talk about a blockchain it’s important to mention a few things

* A blockchain, used for the purpose of recording historical transactions, is a database with a default view-all permission.
* A blockchain, is possible to not be always writable in the desired timeframe because of network traffic.
* A blockchain, is amazing at a lot of things but having reference records which are perfect milliseconds after that records initial introduction is not one of them.
