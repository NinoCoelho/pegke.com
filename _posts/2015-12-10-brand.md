      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The Pegke Loyalty marks include the Pegke Loyalty name and logo, and any word, phrase, image, or other designation that identifies the source or origin of any of Pegke Loyalty's products. Please don't modify the marks or use them in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Pegke Loyalty, or in a way that confuses Pegke Loyalty with another brand (including your own).

  <h3 class="ui header teal">Visual design of your website or application</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design your site with unique branding and logos. Do not copy or imitate the look and feel of the Pegke Loyalty website or apps, as this could create user confusion.</li>
    <li>If utilizing the Pegke Loyalty API to support your service or application, you must feature a prominent banner noting your service is "not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Pegke Loyalty, Inc."</li>
    <li>You must not use, display, mirror or frame (including in meta-tags or hidden text) Pegke Loyalty websites, or any individual element of Pegke Loyalty websites, Pegke Loyalty's name, trademarks, logos or other proprietary information, or the layout and design of any page or form contained on a page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Naming</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You're entitled to say that your website or application is integrated with Pegke Loyalty (we like people integrating with Pegke Loyalty!), but please don't use the Pegke Loyalty marks as part of the name of your company, application, product, or service, or in any logo you create.</li>
    <li>Do not register a domain containing ‚ÄúPegke Loyalty‚Äù, misspellings, transliterations or similar variations thereof. That would be very uncool.</li>
    <li>Do not apply for a trademark with a name including ‚ÄúPegke Loyalty‚Äù, the Pegke Loyalty hash, transliterations or similar variations thereof.</li>
  </ul>
