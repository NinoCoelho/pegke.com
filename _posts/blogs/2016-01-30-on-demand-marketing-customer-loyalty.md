Digital media drove a shift in marketers’ budgets to “always-on” digital media, such as search, display, and social.  That focus is moving now to “always relevant” marketing. For brands and their agencies, this shift requires a much more sophisticated and targeted approach to address the ubiquity of touch points so that they can be there at a consumer’s moment of need—no matter where or when it is. In this environment, advertising needs to become a service.

To win over on-demand customers, brands must know them, what they assume, and what works with him or her, and then have the chance to reach them with the right kind of interaction. Data lies in the middle of these efforts. To build the necessary level connected with understanding, companies need several distinct data lenses.

A particular view of the vast and long-term trends on the market, category, and brand is vital. Digital sources that track what people are trying to find (search), what people say (social monitoring), and what folks are doing (tracking online, mobile, and in-store activities) signify rivers of input providing constant warning signs of trouble or indicators of latent opportunity. Many companies are drowning in reports from vendors providing most of these information tools, yet few have a lot clarity on which things they have to look for and who must know what.
